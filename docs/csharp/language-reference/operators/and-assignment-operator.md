# &amp;= Operator (C# Reference)

The AND assignment operator.

An expression using the `&=` operator, such as

```csharp
x &= y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
x = x & y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

For integer operands, the [`&` operator](and-operator.md) computes the bitwise logical AND of its operands; for [bool](../keywords/bool.md) operands, it computes the logical AND of its operands.

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `&=` operator:

## Operator overloadability

If a user-defined type [overloads](../keywords/operator.md) the [`&` operator](and-operator.md), the AND assignment operator `&=` is implicitly overloaded. A user-defined type cannot explicitly overload the AND assignment operator.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Compound assignment](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#compound-assignment) section of the [C# language specification](../language-specification/index.md).
