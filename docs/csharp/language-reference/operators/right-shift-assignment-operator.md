# >>= operator (C# Reference)

The right-shift assignment operator.

## Remarks

An expression of the form

```csharp
x >>= y
```

is evaluated as

```csharp
x = x >> y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [>> operator](right-shift-operator.md) shifts `x` right by an amount specified by `y`.

The >>= operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [>> operator](right-shift-operator.md) (see [operator](../keywords/operator.md)).
