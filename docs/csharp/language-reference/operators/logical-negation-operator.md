# ! operator (C# Reference)

The logical negation operator (`!`) is a unary operator that negates its operand. It is defined for `bool` and returns `true` if and only if its operand is `false`.

## Remarks

User-defined types can overload the `!` operator (see [operator](../keywords/operator.md)).

## Example

[!code-csharp[csRefOperators#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefOperators/CS/csrefOperators.cs#7)]
